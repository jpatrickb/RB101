=begin
Write a method that takes a string as argument, and returns true if all parentheses in the string are 
properly balanced, false otherwise. To be properly balanced, parentheses must occur in matching '(' 
and ')' pairs.

Examples:

balanced?('What (is) this?') == true
balanced?('What is) this?') == false
balanced?('What (is this?') == false
balanced?('((What) (is this))?') == true
balanced?('((What)) (is this))?') == false
balanced?('Hey!') == true
balanced?(')Hey!(') == false
balanced?('What ((is))) up(') == false
Note that balanced pairs must each start with a (, not a ).

===================================================================================================
*** (Understand the) Problem: ***

First identify the inputs and the outputs of the problem.

input: a string


output: boolean dependent on if parenthesis are balanced in string
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
Check for Problem Domain/Explicit requirements: The Problem Domain is the area of expertise or 
application that needs to be examined to solve a problem. 

Explicit Domain: 

_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
Check for Implicit Requirements.  Are there requirements that are not explicitly stated?

Implicit Requirements:

Clarifying Questions:  Some questions to ask the interviewer (or perhaps yourself) to better 
understand the problem.
1. The seventh example seems balanced.  must all chars in string be encapsalated in parenthesis?
2.
3.

Mental Model:  A summary of the "entire problem" written in your own words.  *What* the problem requires,
not *how*.  (How is implemented in the Algorithm)
  

 determine if in the string there is no open-ended parenthesis by counting plus one for each
 encountered ( thand minus one for each encountered ) if the number becomes negetive, the balance
 is wrong...if after the count the value is zero....the string is balanced

*** Examples / Test Cases / Edge Cases: ***

Examples: 

Come up with examples that validate your understanding of the problem, confirm
that you are working in the right direction.  Typically the confirmation will come from documentation of 
a process, or a person.

Your Examples: 

   


_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
Test Cases:
Note: Rules for a specific problem are an excellent place to find test cases.  If you're 
working with collections, it's a good idea to find test cases that deal with zero, one or multiple
elements in the collection.  


Your Test Cases: 

_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
Edge Cases:
Edge cases are situations that occur along the "edge" of a specific problem.  For example: problems that 
involve iterating over numbers have edge cases that are at both ends of the range.  Typically can 
involve working with negative numbers, 0, or extremely high values, empty, nil, {}, [].

Your Edge Cases:


===================================================================================================
*** Data Structure:***

Next determine what data structures you will work with to convert the input to the desired output.
Are you going to use arrays, hashes, etc?
Your data structure will influence your program.

string


==================================================================================================
*** Algorithm: ***

** THE CHIEF OBJECTIVE HERE is to determine a series of instructions that will transform the input
into the desired output.
    Test manually with test cases?

  1. initialize counter variable
  2. each char of string that is '(' add 1, each ')' minus 1
  3. break if the count becomes negative
  4. then check to see if the count is zero

    count += 1 if char == mark1
