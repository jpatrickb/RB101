A triangle is classified as follows:

right One angle of the triangle is a right angle (90 degrees)
acute All 3 angles of the triangle are less than 90 degrees
obtuse One angle is greater than 90 degrees.
To be a valid triangle, the sum of the angles must be exactly 180 degrees, and all angles must be 
greater than 0: if either of these conditions is not satisfied, the triangle is invalid.

Write a method that takes the 3 angles of a triangle as arguments, and returns a symbol :right, 
:acute, :obtuse, or :invalid depending on whether the triangle is a right, acute, obtuse, or invalid 
triangle.

You may assume integer valued angles so you don't have to worry about floating point errors. You may 
also assume that the arguments are specified in degrees.

Examples:

triangle(60, 70, 50) == :acute
triangle(30, 90, 60) == :right
triangle(120, 50, 10) == :obtuse
triangle(0, 90, 90) == :invalid
triangle(50, 50, 50) == :invalid


===================================================================================================
*** (Understand the) Problem: ***

First identify the inputs and the outputs of the problem.

input: three whole degree numbers


output: type of traingle or invalid

Check for Problem Domain/Explicit requirements: The Problem Domain is the area of expertise or 
application that needs to be examined to solve a problem. 

Explicit Domain: the definition of each type of triangle

Check for Implicit Requirements.  Are there requirements that are not explicitly stated?

Implicit Requirements: 

_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
Clarifying Questions:  Some questions to ask the interviewer (or perhaps yourself) to better 
understand the problem.
1. 
2.
3.

Mental Model:  A summary of the "entire problem" written in your own words.  *What* the problem requires,
not *how*.  (How is implemented in the Algorithm)
  
first check validity, use case statements like last method, then give formula for each

*** Examples / Test Cases / Edge Cases: ***

Examples: 

Come up with examples that validate your understanding of the problem, confirm
that you are working in the right direction.  Typically the confirmation will come from documentation of 
a process, or a person.

Test Cases:
Note: Rules for a specific problem are an excellent place to find test cases.  If you're 
working with collections, it's a good idea to find test cases that deal with zero, one or multiple
elements in the collection.

Edge Cases:
Edge cases are situations that occur along the "edge" of a specific problem.  For example: problems that 
involve iterating over numbers have edge cases that are at both ends of the range.  Typically can 
involve working with negative numbers, 0, or extremely high values, empty, nil, {}, [].




===================================================================================================
*** Data Structure:***

Next determine what data structures you will work with to convert the input to the desired output.
Are you going to use arrays, hashes, etc?
Your data structure will influence your program.

array, case statement


==================================================================================================
*** Algorithm: ***

** THE CHIEF OBJECTIVE HERE is to determine a series of instructions that will transform the input
into the desired output.
    Test manually with test cases?

  1. assign angles to an array
  2. case when the array include <=0 or all angles don't equal 180
    invalid
  3. provide other cases
  4. end
