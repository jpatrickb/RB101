If you take a number like 735291, and rotate it to the left, you get 352917. If you now keep the first 
digit fixed in place, and rotate the remaining digits, you get 329175. Keep the first 2 digits fixed 
in place and rotate again to 321759. Keep the first 3 digits fixed in place and rotate again to get 
321597. Finally, keep the first 4 digits fixed in place and rotate the final 2 digits to get 321579. 
The resulting number is called the maximum rotation of the original number.

Write a method that takes an integer as argument, and returns the maximum rotation of that argument. 
You can (and probably should) use the rotate_rightmost_digits method from the previous exercise.

Note that you do not have to handle multiple 0s.

Example:

max_rotation(735291) == 321579
max_rotation(3) == 3
max_rotation(35) == 53
max_rotation(105) == 15 # the leading zero gets dropped
max_rotation(8_703_529_146) == 7_321_609_845

===================================================================================================
*** (Understand the) Problem: ***

First identify the inputs and the outputs of the problem.

input: integer


output: maximum rotation of integer

Check for Problem Domain/Explicit requirements: The Problem Domain is the area of expertise or 
application that needs to be examined to solve a problem. 

Explicit Domain: the formula for maximum rotation

Check for Implicit Requirements.  Are there requirements that are not explicitly stated?

Clarifying Questions:  Some questions to ask the interviewer (or perhaps yourself) to better 
understand the problem.

Mental Model:  A summary of the "entire problem" written in your own words.  *What* the problem requires,
not *how*.  (How is implemented in the Algorithm)
  


Your Mental Model: the number has to be rotated like in the previous method for every n number of digits
from it's full length down to the last two digits

*** Examples / Test Cases / Edge Cases: ***

Examples: 

Come up with examples that validate your understanding of the problem, confirm
that you are working in the right direction.  Typically the confirmation will come from documentation of 
a process, or a person.

Your Examples:

Test Cases:
Note: Rules for a specific problem are an excellent place to find test cases.  If you're 
working with collections, it's a good idea to find test cases that deal with zero, one or multiple
elements in the collection.  


Your Test Cases: 

_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
Edge Cases:
Edge cases are situations that occur along the "edge" of a specific problem.  For example: problems that 
involve iterating over numbers have edge cases that are at both ends of the range.  Typically can 
involve working with negative numbers, 0, or extremely high values, empty, nil, {}, [].

Your Edge Cases:


===================================================================================================
*** Data Structure:***

Next determine what data structures you will work with to convert the input to the desired output.
Are you going to use arrays, hashes, etc?
Your data structure will influence your program.

integer to string to array


==================================================================================================
*** Algorithm: ***

** THE CHIEF OBJECTIVE HERE is to determine a series of instructions that will transform the input
into the desired output.
    Test manually with test cases?
    
    1. turn integer into string into an array
    2. rotate_rightmost_digits with n being == to array.length
    3. rotate that number with n one less and so on untill it is done with n as 2
    4. return array to integer
    5. end
