The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers starting with 1 and 1 where each number is the sum of 
the two previous numbers: the 3rd Fibonacci number is 1 + 1 = 2, the 4th is 1 + 2 = 3, the 5th is 
2 + 3 = 5, and so on. In mathematical terms:

F(1) = 1
F(2) = 1
F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2) where n > 2
Sequences like this translate naturally as "recursive" methods. A recursive method is one in which 
the method calls itself. For example:

def sum(n)
  return 1 if n == 1
  n + sum(n - 1)
end
sum is a recursive method that computes the sum of all integers between 1 and n.

Recursive methods have three primary qualities:

They call themselves at least once.
They have a condition that stops the recursion (n == 1 above).
They use the result returned by themselves.
In the code above, sum calls itself once; it uses a condition of n == 1 to stop recursing; and, 
n + sum(n - 1) uses the return value of the recursive call to compute a new return value.

Write a recursive method that computes the nth Fibonacci number, where nth is an argument to the 
method.

*** (Understand the) Problem: ***

First identify the inputs and the outputs of the problem.

input: number


output: the value of the nth that place in the fib sequence

Check for Problem Domain/Explicit requirements: The Problem Domain is the area of expertise or 
application that needs to be examined to solve a problem. 

Explicit Domain:

Check for Implicit Requirements.  Are there requirements that are not explicitly stated?

Clarifying Questions:  Some questions to ask the interviewer (or perhaps yourself) to better 
understand the problem.

*** Examples / Test Cases / Edge Cases: ***

Examples: 

Come up with examples that validate your understanding of the problem, confirm
that you are working in the right direction.  Typically the confirmation will come from documentation of 
a process, or a person.

Your Examples:

Test Cases:
Note: Rules for a specific problem are an excellent place to find test cases.  If you're 
working with collections, it's a good idea to find test cases that deal with zero, one or multiple
elements in the collection.  


Your Test Cases:

Edge Cases:
Edge cases are situations that occur along the "edge" of a specific problem.  For example: problems that 
involve iterating over numbers have edge cases that are at both ends of the range.  Typically can 
involve working with negative numbers, 0, or extremely high values, empty, nil, {}, [].

Your Edge Cases:


===================================================================================================
*** Data Structure:***

Next determine what data structures you will work with to convert the input to the desired output.
Are you going to use arrays, hashes, etc?
Your data structure will influence your program.




==================================================================================================
*** Algorithm: ***

** THE CHIEF OBJECTIVE HERE is to determine a series of instructions that will transform the input
into the desired output.
    Test manually with test cases?
