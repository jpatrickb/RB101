#Create a simple tip calculator. The program should prompt for a bill amount and a tip rate. 
#The program must compute the tip and then display both the tip and the total amount of the bill.

#Example:

#What is the bill? 200
#What is the tip percentage? 15

#The tip is $30.0
#The total is $230.0

*** (Understand the) Problem: ***

First identify the inputs and the outputs of the problem.

input: bill and tip percentage


output: tip amount and total bill amount

Check for Problem Domain/Explicit requirements: The Problem Domain is the area of expertise or 
application that needs to be examined to solve a problem.

Check for Implicit Requirements.  Are there requirements that are not explicitly stated?

Clarifying Questions:  Some questions to ask the interviewer (or perhaps yourself) to better 
understand the problem.

Mental Model:  A summary of the "entire problem" written in your own words.  *What* the problem requires,
not *how*.  (How is implemented in the Algorithm)
  
As a rule of thumb, you can keep the number of mental models to one if it fully, and accurately,
captures the requirements of the problem.

Your Mental Model: will get info from user then calculate and interpolate into string

*** Examples / Test Cases / Edge Cases: ***

Examples: 

Come up with examples that validate your understanding of the problem, confirm
that you are working in the right direction.  Typically the confirmation will come from documentation of 
a process, or a person.

Test Cases:
Note: Rules for a specific problem are an excellent place to find test cases.  If you're 
working with collections, it's a good idea to find test cases that deal with zero, one or multiple
elements in the collection.  
Try to provide test cases that handle any edge cases you can find.

Edge Cases:
Edge cases are situations that occur along the "edge" of a specific problem.  For example: problems that 
involve iterating over numbers have edge cases that are at both ends of the range.  Typically can 
involve working with negative numbers, 0, or extremely high values, empty, nil, {}, [].

Your Edge Cases:


===================================================================================================
*** Data Structure:***

Next determine what data structures you will work with to convert the input to the desired output.
Are you going to use arrays, hashes, etc?
Your data structure will influence your program.




==================================================================================================
*** Algorithm: ***

** THE CHIEF OBJECTIVE HERE is to determine a series of instructions that will transform the input
into the desired output.
    Test manually with test cases?

1. Ask for input about tip and bill amount from user
2. multiply total times tip percentage to get tip amount
3. add tip amount to total
4. return tip and new total values to user

=end

#code

puts "Please enter the total bill amount:"
bill = gets.chomp.to_f
puts "Please enter tip percentage:"
percentage = gets.chomp.to_f / 100

tip = bill * percentage 

total = bill + tip

puts "The tip is: $#{tip.round(2)}."
puts "The total bill is $#{total.round(2)}."
