The Fibonacci series is a series of numbers (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...) such that the first 2 
numbers are 1 by definition, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two previous numbers. 
This series appears throughout the natural world.

Computationally, the Fibonacci series is a very simple series, but the results grow at an 
incredibly rapid rate. For example, the 100th Fibonacci number is 354,224,848,179,261,915,075 -- 
that's enormous, especially considering that it takes 6 iterations before it generates the first 
2 digit number.

Write a method that calculates and returns the index of the first Fibonacci number that has the 
number of digits specified as an argument. (The first Fibonacci number has index 1.)

Examples:

find_fibonacci_index_by_length(2) == 7          # 1 1 2 3 5 8 13
find_fibonacci_index_by_length(3) == 12         # 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144
find_fibonacci_index_by_length(10) == 45
find_fibonacci_index_by_length(100) == 476
find_fibonacci_index_by_length(1000) == 4782
find_fibonacci_index_by_length(10000) == 47847

*** (Understand the) Problem: ***

First identify the inputs and the outputs of the problem.

input: fibonacci digit size 


output: index number where that size first appears

Check for Problem Domain/Explicit requirements: The Problem Domain is the area of expertise or 
application that needs to be examined to solve a problem. 

Explicit Domain: retrieve digit size from place in fib sequence

_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
Check for Implicit Requirements.  Are there requirements that are not explicitly stated?

Implicit Requirements: at what pattern in a fibonacci sequence do digit sizes grow?

_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
Clarifying Questions:  Some questions to ask the interviewer (or perhaps yourself) to better 
understand the problem.

Mental Model:  A summary of the "entire problem" written in your own words.  *What* the problem requires,
not *how*.  (How is implemented in the Algorithm)
  


Your Mental Model: compute fib sequence, break at requested number size, count index

*** Examples / Test Cases / Edge Cases: ***

Examples: 

Come up with examples that validate your understanding of the problem, confirm
that you are working in the right direction.  Typically the confirmation will come from documentation of 
a process, or a person.

Test Cases:
Note: Rules for a specific problem are an excellent place to find test cases.  If you're 
working with collections, it's a good idea to find test cases that deal with zero, one or multiple
elements in the collection.  
Try to provide test cases that handle any edge cases you can find.
If you're working with collections, it's a good idea to find test cases that deal with zero, one or
multiple elements in the collection.

Edge Cases:
Edge cases are situations that occur along the "edge" of a specific problem.  For example: problems that 
involve iterating over numbers have edge cases that are at both ends of the range.  Typically can 
involve working with negative numbers, 0, or extremely high values, empty, nil, {}, [].

Your Edge Cases:

*** Data Structure:***

Next determine what data structures you will work with to convert the input to the desired output.
Are you going to use arrays, hashes, etc?
Your data structure will influence your program.

array


==================================================================================================
*** Algorithm: ***

** THE CHIEF OBJECTIVE HERE is to determine a series of instructions that will transform the input
into the desired output.
    Test manually with test cases?

 1.get argument from method
 2.generate fibonocci sequence into array with loop
 3.break when requested number size appears
 4.get size of array and add 1 for fib. index
