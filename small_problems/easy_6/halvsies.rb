Write a method that takes an Array as an argument, and returns two Arrays (as a pair of nested Arrays)
 that contain the first half and second half of the original Array, respectively. If the original 
 array contains an odd number of elements, the middle element should be placed in the first half 
 Array.

Examples:

halvsies([1, 2, 3, 4]) == [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
halvsies([1, 5, 2, 4, 3]) == [[1, 5, 2], [4, 3]]
halvsies([5]) == [[5], []]
halvsies([]) == [[], []]

===================================================================================================
*** (Understand the) Problem: ***

First identify the inputs and the outputs of the problem.

input: one array


output: nested arrays, of original halved, larger one goes first for odd arguments

Check for Problem Domain/Explicit requirements: The Problem Domain is the area of expertise or 
application that needs to be examined to solve a problem. 

Explicit Domain: 

_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
Check for Implicit Requirements.  Are there requirements that are not explicitly stated?

Clarifying Questions:  Some questions to ask the interviewer (or perhaps yourself) to better 
understand the problem.

Mental Model:  A summary of the "entire problem" written in your own words.  *What* the problem requires,
not *how*.  (How is implemented in the Algorithm)
  


Your Mental Model: can loop to solve problem with conditional break

*** Examples / Test Cases / Edge Cases: ***

Examples: 

Come up with examples that validate your understanding of the problem, confirm
that you are working in the right direction.  Typically the confirmation will come from documentation of 
a process, or a person.

Your Examples:

Test Cases:
Note: Rules for a specific problem are an excellent place to find test cases.  If you're 
working with collections, it's a good idea to find test cases that deal with zero, one or multiple
elements in the collection.  
Try to provide test cases that handle any edge cases you can find.
If you're working with collections, it's a good idea to find test cases that deal with zero, one or
multiple elements in the collection.

Edge Cases:
Edge cases are situations that occur along the "edge" of a specific problem.  For example: problems that 
involve iterating over numbers have edge cases that are at both ends of the range.  Typically can 
involve working with negative numbers, 0, or extremely high values, empty, nil, {}, [].

Your Edge Cases:


===================================================================================================
*** Data Structure:***

Next determine what data structures you will work with to convert the input to the desired output.
Are you going to use arrays, hashes, etc?
Your data structure will influence your program.

arrays


==================================================================================================
*** Algorithm: ***

** THE CHIEF OBJECTIVE HERE is to determine a series of instructions that will transform the input
into the desired output.
    Test manually with test cases?

1. given one argument append first half of array into new array

  loop do
   new_array << array.slice!(0)   
   break if new_array.size >= array.size / 2
  end

end

p halvsies([1, 2, 3, 4]) #== [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
