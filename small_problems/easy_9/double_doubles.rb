=begin
A double number is a number with an even number of digits whose left-side digits are exactly the same 
as its right-side digits. For example, 44, 3333, 103103, 7676 are all double numbers. 444, 334433, and 
107 are not.

Write a method that returns 2 times the number provided as an argument, unless the argument is a 
double number; double numbers should be returned as-is.

Examples:

twice(37) == 74
twice(44) == 44
twice(334433) == 668866
twice(444) == 888
twice(107) == 214
twice(103103) == 103103
twice(3333) == 3333
twice(7676) == 7676
twice(123_456_789_123_456_789) == 123_456_789_123_456_789
twice(5) == 10

Note: underscores are used for clarity above. Ruby lets you use underscores when writing long numbers;
 however, it does not print the underscores when printing long numbers. Don't be alarmed if you don't 
 see the underscores when running your tests.



===================================================================================================
*** (Understand the) Problem: ***

First identify the inputs and the outputs of the problem.

input: number


output: double number, unless already double

Check for Problem Domain/Explicit requirements: The Problem Domain is the area of expertise or 
application that needs to be examined to solve a problem. 

Explicit Domain: 

_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
Check for Implicit Requirements.  Are there requirements that are not explicitly stated?

Implicit Requirements: 

_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
Clarifying Questions:  Some questions to ask the interviewer (or perhaps yourself) to better 
understand the problem.
1. 
2.
3.

Mental Model:  A summary of the "entire problem" written in your own words.  *What* the problem requires,
not *how*.  (How is implemented in the Algorithm)
  


Your Mental Model: check if number is double, build new number will loop

*** Examples / Test Cases / Edge Cases: ***

Examples: 

Come up with examples that validate your understanding of the problem, confirm
that you are working in the right direction.  Typically the confirmation will come from documentation of 
a process, or a person.

Your Examples:

Test Cases:
Note: Rules for a specific problem are an excellent place to find test cases.  If you're 
working with collections, it's a good idea to find test cases that deal with zero, one or multiple
elements in the collection.  


Your Test Cases: 

_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
Edge Cases:
Edge cases are situations that occur along the "edge" of a specific problem.  For example: problems that 
involve iterating over numbers have edge cases that are at both ends of the range.  Typically can 
involve working with negative numbers, 0, or extremely high values, empty, nil, {}, [].

Your Edge Cases:


===================================================================================================
*** Data Structure:***

Next determine what data structures you will work with to convert the input to the desired output.
Are you going to use arrays, hashes, etc?
Your data structure will influence your program.

numbers string


==================================================================================================
*** Algorithm: ***

** THE CHIEF OBJECTIVE HERE is to determine a series of instructions that will transform the input
into the desired output.
    Test manually with test cases?

  1. take number from argument
  2. turn into a string
  3. check if first half == second half
    a. string length divided by 2 as endpoint to slice of string
  4. if not double put a double with + sign
  5. return integer
