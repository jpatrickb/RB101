#Write a program that will ask a user for an input of a word or multiple words and give back 
#the number of characters. Spaces should not be counted as a character.

#input:
#Please write word or multiple words: walk

#output:
#There are 4 characters in "walk".

#input:
#Please write word or multiple words: walk, don't run

#output:
#There are 13 characters in "walk, don't run".

*** (Understand the) Problem: ***

First identify the inputs and the outputs of the problem.

input: string of word or words


output: number of characters counted, exclude spaces
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
Check for Problem Domain/Explicit requirements: The Problem Domain is the area of expertise or 
application that needs to be examined to solve a problem. 

Problem Domain: move string to array for counting of chars

_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
Check for Implicit Requirements.  Are there requirements that are not explicitly stated?

Implicit Requirements: 

_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
Clarifying Questions:  Some questions to ask the interviewer (or perhaps yourself) to better 
understand the problem.
1.

Mental Model:  A summary of the "entire problem" written in your own words.  *What* the problem requires,
not *how*.  (How is implemented in the Algorithm)
  
As a rule of thumb, you can keep the number of mental models to one if it fully, and accurately,
captures the requirements of the problem.

Your Mental Model: split string to an array, subtract spaces, output length of array

*** Examples / Test Cases / Edge Cases: ***

Examples: 

Come up with examples that validate your understanding of the problem, confirm
that you are working in the right direction.  Typically the confirmation will come from documentation of 
a process, or a person.

Test Cases:
Note: Rules for a specific problem are an excellent place to find test cases.  If you're 
working with collections, it's a good idea to find test cases that deal with zero, one or multiple
elements in the collection.  
Try to provide test cases that handle any edge cases you can find.
If you're working with collections, it's a good idea to find test cases that deal with zero, one or
multiple elements in the collection.

Your Test Cases:

Edge Cases:
Edge cases are situations that occur along the "edge" of a specific problem.  For example: problems that 
involve iterating over numbers have edge cases that are at both ends of the range.  Typically can 
involve working with negative numbers, 0, or extremely high values, empty, nil, {}, [].

Your Edge Cases:


===================================================================================================
*** Data Structure:***

Next determine what data structures you will work with to convert the input to the desired output.
Are you going to use arrays, hashes, etc?
Your data structure will influence your program.


array

==================================================================================================
*** Algorithm: ***

** THE CHIEF OBJECTIVE HERE is to determine a series of instructions that will transform the input
into the desired output.
    Test manually with test cases?

    1. get input string
    2. split string into an array
    3. remove any spaces if they exist? with join
    4. output string length

#code

puts "Please write a word or multiple words:"
string = gets.chomp
length = string.split.join.length

puts "The string '#{string}' has #{length} characters in it."

print 'Please write word or multiple words: '
input = gets.chomp
number_of_characters = input.delete(' ').size
puts "There are #{number_of_characters} characters in \"#{input}\"."
